        <h1>HEY, I'M MANSVI<br />NICE TO MEET YOU!</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a final-year Computer Science student at NIT Uttarakhand with a
          passion for full-stack development and tech education. Currently
          building real-world projects and teaching Java through my YouTube
          channel.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Mansvi, a final-year Computer Science student at
            <strong>National Institute of Technology, Uttarakhand</strong>, with
            a strong passion for full-stack development, problem-solving, and
            teaching. I enjoy taking ideas from scratch and turning them into
            real, user-focused web products.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in learning by building. My technical journey has been
            shaped by hands-on experience â€” whether itâ€™s developing platforms
            like EvKarya, creating interactive JavaScript-based games, or
            sharing my knowledge through my YouTube channel where I teach core
            Java and computer science concepts in a simple and visual way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from development, I love organizing my thoughts through
            writing, designing clean user interfaces, and simplifying tough
            technical topics for others. Iâ€™m currently focused on building
            scalable applications, contributing to open source, and preparing
            for industry roles in product development or developer advocacy.

            As a developer and educator, I take a pragmatic and purpose-driven
            approach to problem solving. I focus on understanding core goals,
            user needs, and the impact of my work â€” always aligning my solutions
            with both product vision and real-world outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I value flexibility and creativity, but I also know when to slow
            down and design thoughtfully. My strengths lie in balancing speed
            with quality, managing multiple projects at once, and collaborating
            closely with designers, developers, and product teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether Iâ€™m writing code, designing user experiences, or creating
            educational content, Iâ€™m driven by growth â€” of the product, the
            people I work with, and the learners I teach. Iâ€™m passionate about
            building with intention and delivering meaningful results.

            <h3>EvKarya â€“ Event Services Platform</h3>
            <p>
              EvKarya is a full-stack event service platform designed to help
              users seamlessly connect with verified vendors for weddings,
              parties, and other occasions. The platform allows users to explore
              vendor categories like photography, catering, attire, and
              entertainment, and manage bookings end-to-end.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project was built by a team of three, with each member
              contributing to key modules across the platform. My primary
              responsibility was to design and develop the
              <strong>admin panel</strong>, which enables efficient management
              of vendor data, post approvals, user orders, service categories,
              and availability tracking.
            </p>

            <p>
              The admin panel includes vendor and user management tools, booking
              oversight, and post moderation, ensuring smooth operation and
              control of the entire platform. I also worked on integrating
              real-time updates and user notifications to enhance platform
              responsiveness.

            <h3>Classic Snake Game â€“ Python</h3>
            <p>
              A modern version of the classic Snake Game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features dynamic movement, collision detection, score tracking, and an expanding snake mechanism with increasing difficulty.
            </p>

            <p>
              The project is structured using OOP principles with separate modules for snake behavior, food generation, score handling, and game-over display. It listens to real-time user input via keyboard arrow keys and provides a clean, interactive visual experience within a 600x600 canvas.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Turtle module, OOP (Classes/Modules)</li>
              <li><strong>Features:</strong> Real-time controls, wall and tail collision detection, auto-increasing score and length</li>
              <li><strong>Role:</strong> Solo Developer</li>
              <li><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> Event-driven programming, game loop logic, screen update handling, modular design</li>
